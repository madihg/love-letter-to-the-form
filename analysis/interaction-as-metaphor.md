# Love Letter to the Form: Interaction-as-Metaphor Analysis

## Document Purpose

This is a detailed electronic literature and UX analysis of "Love Letter to the Form" by Halim Madi. It covers the poetic function of each interaction, proposes HTML element mappings for Part 5, traces the emotional arc, examines the footnote system, and extracts lessons from the reference piece "We Called Us Poetry."

## 1. Part-by-Part Interaction-as-Metaphor Analysis

### Part 1: The Lens as Emotional Regulator

**Text:** "In 'Autobiography of Red', the camera acts as Geryon's emotional regulator. // The lens is a locked bedroom door. A border. And borders, as you get to know them, reveal themselves as more than enclosures. Borders filter, sort, peel // the figure from the ground."

**Interaction sequence:**
1. Red streak appears behind the opening line and persists.
2. A button labeled "the lens" summons a round black optometrist's lens over the text.
3. Repeated clicks cycle the text visible through the lens: "is a locked bedroom door" -> "a border" -> "And borders, as you get to know them," -> "reveal themselves as more than enclosures."
4. Final click: the red streak turns white, background turns black, text turns white.

**Analysis:**

The optometrist's lens is the piece's first and most loaded metaphor. In an eye exam, you look *through* a series of lenses while someone asks "better or worse?" -- the lens does not change what is there, it changes how clearly you perceive it. By placing a circular lens over the text and cycling the content with each click, the reader literally performs the act of refocusing. Each click is a corrective lens snapping into place. The text does not scroll or animate -- it *replaces*, the way a new prescription replaces the blur with a different clarity.

This mirrors Geryon's camera in Anne Carson's "Autobiography of Red." Geryon photographs not to document but to regulate -- the camera creates a frame that makes overwhelming experience manageable. The lens interaction forces the reader into Geryon's position: you can only see what the frame permits. The rest of the text is hidden outside the circle, just as Geryon's emotional life is hidden behind the viewfinder.

The red streak is the affective residue of the opening -- the color of Geryon himself (the "red monster" of myth and Carson's retelling). Its persistence anchors the section in a specific emotional register. When the final click inverts everything -- red to white, white to black, black to white -- it is a literal figure-ground reversal. The phrase "peel the figure from the ground" is enacted in real time. The reader does not just read about borders; they experience the border's function: to filter, sort, peel perception itself.

**Key design principle:** The interaction here is *optical*. It concerns seeing and not-seeing, focus and blur. Everything should feel clinical and precise -- the lens click should feel like an optometrist's phoropter snapping, not a playful toggle.

### Part 2: The Slot Machine as Identity Erosion

**Text:** "I am not hiding. I am peeling parts -- if you were to see me -- really see me -- we would both blush and so I build borders -- the interface a drag sequin bodysuit drag of course both gesture and posture. It's hard to write a straight text anymore and so I write in code."

**Interaction sequence:**
1. Slot machine with "I am not trying to hide" -- clicks erode the sentence: "I am trying to hide" -> "I am trying" -> "I am not" -> "I am." Screen inverts back to white.
2. Phrases separated by dashes appear one above the other, stacking like a wall.
3. Draggable rectangles with "the interface / a drag / sequin bodysuit / drag / of course both / gesture and / posture."
4. "It's hard to write a straight text anymore" -- text curls when the cursor approaches.

**Analysis:**

The slot machine is the most formally brilliant interaction in the piece. A slot machine is a device of chance -- you pull the lever and the reels settle on a combination you did not choose. But here, the reader *is* the lever. Each click is deliberate, and the sentence is not randomized but systematically stripped. "I am not trying to hide" loses "not" first -- the negation disappears, converting denial into confession. Then "to hide" vanishes -- intention without object. Then the sentence rebuilds in reverse, "I am not" standing alone as pure negation, before arriving at the kernel: "I am."

This is not a game of chance. It is a game of inevitability disguised as a game of chance. The slot machine form promises randomness but delivers a predetermined dismantling of the self. The reader participates in stripping the poet's linguistic armor, word by word. The "I am" that remains at the end is both the most vulnerable and most foundational statement in the English language -- a cogito arrived at through erasure.

The screen inversion (black to white) at "I am" is critical. After Part 1's inversion (white to black), the return to white signals that the stripping is complete. The darkness was the concealment; the light is the exposure. The poet, having been peeled, stands in daylight.

The stacking wall interaction -- phrases appearing one above the other like bricks -- literalizes "and so I build borders." The reader clicks to add each brick. They are complicit in the construction of the wall between themselves and the poet. This is N. Katherine Hayles' concept of "intermediation" -- the reader's body (clicking, stacking) is enrolled in the poem's meaning-making.

The draggable rectangles ("the interface / a drag / sequin bodysuit") are the piece's most physically interactive moment in Part 2. "Drag" operates on three levels: the drag-and-drop gesture, drag performance, and the drag (burden) of self-presentation. Each rectangle is a garment being pulled off or rearranged. The reader dresses and undresses the text.

The curling text ("it's hard to write a straight text anymore") is a visual pun that also functions as a somatic metaphor. The text literally cannot stay straight -- it bends away from the reader's approach, performing the very difficulty the sentence describes. The cursor becomes a kind of gravity field that warps textual space.

**Key design principle:** Part 2 is about *manipulation* -- of text, of self, of the interface. Every interaction involves the reader physically handling the language. The aesthetic should feel tactile: the slot reels should have visible mechanics, the wall should feel heavy, the rectangles should resist slightly when dragged.

### Part 3: The Camera as Confrontation

**Text:** "Take my face for instance. We would never lock eyes. I am not shy. I am letting on exactly as much as our encounter demands. Take the maiko's eyes. She runs her irises with an iron fist, logs her stares. To look you in the eyes would be as flagrant as bombing the ribs of a mountain."

**Interaction sequence:**
1. "Take my face for instance" -- device camera opens, showing the reader's own face.
2. "I am not shy" -- "Shy" becomes bold, jumps, grows rapidly.
3. Two eyes with irises that follow the mouse/touch.
4. If the mouse pauses in the center zone for 3 seconds, an explosion animation scatters the words and pixels outward.

**Analysis:**

Part 3 is the piece's emotional apex in terms of vulnerability. "Take my face for instance" is an invitation that is immediately subverted: instead of showing the poet's face, the camera shows *yours*. The reader, who has been safely manipulating text from a distance, is suddenly reflected back at themselves. This is John Cayley's "lens of reading" made literal: the text becomes a mirror.

The camera fallback is significant. If the reader denies camera permission, they see a "glinting white-grey surface" -- essentially a blank, opaque screen. This is not a failure state; it is the poem's metaphor completing itself. The reader who refuses to be seen gets a locked door -- the very border the piece has been discussing. If permission is granted, the retro B&W pixelated feed creates distance even within intimacy: you see yourself, but degraded, abstracted, as if through Geryon's camera from Part 1.

"Shy" behaving aggressively -- bolding, jumping, growing -- performs the psychic truth that shyness is not absence but excess. The word refuses to be quiet. It demands space. This is the poet's assertion that "I am not shy" is itself a shy statement, and the interface exposes the contradiction by making the word "shy" the loudest thing on the screen.

The following eyes are the piece's most uncanny interaction. The maiko metaphor is about controlled visibility -- "she runs her irises with an iron fist." But the interface reverses this: the *eyes* follow *you*. The reader is the one being watched. And if you hold still -- if you try to lock eyes, to truly see -- the whole thing explodes. "To look you in the eyes would be as flagrant as bombing the ribs of a mountain." The explosion is not punishment; it is the inevitable consequence of direct confrontation. Some encounters cannot survive being looked at straight on.

**Key design principle:** Part 3 is about *the gaze*. The design should feel intimate and slightly uncomfortable. The camera feed should be unexpected. The eyes should feel alive, not cartoonish -- they should track with subtle latency, like a real person watching you.

---

### Part 4: Drag-to-Transform as Asymmetric Power

**Text:** "Like the maiko, my economy of feelings is a management of asymmetry. Cruel not like a destiny, rather like Heracles towards Geryon in Anne Carson's book. Often tragedy isn't violent, it just doesn't care enough. It is devastating in how its ordinariness meets our infatuation. And so I dole out exactly what this encounter demands. I wield asymmetry."

**Interaction sequence:**
1. "Like the maiko, my economy of feelings" appears with an oblique line; dragging words left-to-right transforms them one by one into "is a management of asymmetry."
2. "Cruel not like a destiny..." -- words appear one by one, then float away and off the screen.

**Analysis:**

The drag-to-transform interaction is the piece's most formally precise metaphor for asymmetry. The reader drags words from one state to another, but the transformation is one-directional and irreversible. You cannot drag back. The oblique line -- a literal visual asymmetry -- separates the two states. The reader performs the "management of asymmetry" by dragging, but they manage nothing: the transformation is predetermined. They are Geryon reaching for Heracles, who has already turned away.

The floating words in the second passage are the piece's most melancholic interaction. "Often tragedy isn't violent, it just doesn't care enough." The words appear -- you read them -- and then they drift off the screen, indifferent to whether you have finished. They do not wait. They do not linger for your comprehension. This is the cruelty of Heracles: not violence, but a casual departure. The reader is left watching language leave, unable to hold it. This is what Espen Aarseth would call "ergodic" reading at its most poignant: the text requires effort to traverse, but the effort does not guarantee possession.

**Key design principle:** Part 4 is about *loss of control*. The reader's actions should feel consequential but ultimately futile. The floating words should drift at a pace that is just slightly too fast to be comfortable -- readable, but not re-readable. The drag interaction should feel smooth but final.

### Part 5: HTML as Confession

**Text:** "And I am not writing about power. Believe me, I only write about one thing: Love / Money / Fasting / The synapse. The negative space of mind. The electric reach of every pumped neuron. I write about the psychic mirror that turns accident into story and the side characters each of us are into hailed muscled heroes."

**Analysis:**

Part 5 is the piece's coda, and its instruction is the most open: "figure out a cool contextually relevant way to display / animate the words, what about a drop down for instance or a slider or... etc. think up html elements that could be relevant." This is the section where the form-as-metaphor principle must be most tightly coupled to meaning. Each HTML element should not just *display* the text but *be* the text.

The section is a confession. After four parts of elaborate concealment -- lenses, slot machines, walls, eyes -- the poet claims to speak directly. But the claim itself is suspicious: "And I am not writing about power" is a power move. "Believe me" is a phrase that acknowledges the possibility of disbelief. The HTML elements must carry this tension between directness and evasion.

Detailed HTML element mapping follows in Section 2 below.

---

## 2. Part 5: HTML Element Mapping

Each line is paired with an HTML element (or composition of elements) that metaphorically enacts the line's meaning.

### Line 1: "And I am not writing about power."

**Element: `<button>` styled as a disabled/greyed-out submit button**

A `<button>` is the most powerful HTML element -- it *does* things, triggers actions, submits forms, exerts control over the system. A submit button is how you exercise power over an interface. But here it should appear disabled (greyed out, `cursor: not-allowed`). The reader sees it, reads the text on it -- "And I am not writing about power" -- and instinctively wants to click it. When they do click, the button briefly flashes active (black border, full color) before returning to disabled. The button denies its own power while possessing it entirely. This is the HTML equivalent of saying "I am not writing about power" in a poem -- the very statement is an exercise of authorial power.

**Alternative:** A `<form>` element wrapping the text, with no action attribute and no submit handler. A form with nowhere to go. Power with no outlet.

### Line 2: "Believe me,"

**Element: `<label>` with an associated but hidden `<input type="checkbox">`**

A `<label>` in HTML is a trust contract -- it tells you what an input does. "Believe me" is a label for something the reader cannot verify. The checkbox is hidden or invisible (`opacity: 0`), so the reader sees the label -- the plea -- but cannot check whether it is true. The comma at the end (the trailing breath, the pause) should hang in space, slightly offset, as if the sentence is reaching forward into the next line. When the reader clicks "Believe me," the hidden checkbox toggles, but nothing visibly changes. Trust without evidence.

### Line 3: "I only write about one thing"

**Element: `<select>` (dropdown) with a single `<option>`**

A `<select>` dropdown promises choice -- it is the interface's way of saying "there are options." But this dropdown contains only one option: "one thing." The reader clicks to expand the dropdown and finds there is nothing to choose. The constraint of the `<select>` with a single `<option>` perfectly mirrors the constraint of the line: the appearance of multiplicity concealing a singularity. The dropdown should use the minimal styling -- thin black border, white background, Times New Roman text.

### Line 4: "Love / Money / Fasting / The synapse"

**Element: Text with glitch/distortion effect (CSS `clip-path` and `transform` scramble), cycling on click**

This is specified in the source text: "love appears first, when i click, it glitches, and money appears. click again and money appears again fasting appears, again, the synapse appears." The glitch should feel like a transmission error -- the word scrambles (letters rearranging, brief character-level noise via rapid text replacement with random characters before settling on the next word) and then resolves into the next term. This is not a smooth transition; it is a rupture. Each word in the sequence names something that consumes the self entirely: love, money, fasting, the synapse. The glitch is the moment of transformation between obsessions -- the static between channels.

**Implementation note:** The text distortion should use a rapid cycling of random characters (monospace Courier New for the glitch frames, then snapping to Times New Roman for the resolved word). The visual register-shift between fonts *is* the glitch. The Courier New characters are the machine showing through the literary surface.

### Line 5: "The negative space of mind."

**Element: `<details>` / `<summary>` -- but inverted**

`<details>` is HTML's native mechanism for revealing hidden content. But here, use it backwards: the `<summary>` (visible part) is empty or displays only a period/dot, and when the reader opens it, the full line appears. The "negative space" is literally the space where text should be but is not -- until the reader actively opens it. The negative space of the `<details>` element when closed IS the negative space of mind. The reader must decide to look into the emptiness.

**Styling:** When opened, the text should appear in a lighter grey (#999) -- present but not fully assertive, like a thought you are not sure you had.

### Line 6: "The electric reach of every pumped neuron."

**Element: `<input type="range">` (slider)**

A range slider is a continuous input -- you drag it and a value changes smoothly from minimum to maximum. The text "The electric reach of every pumped neuron" should appear as the slider's label. As the reader drags the slider from left to right, the text increases in letter-spacing -- the letters spread apart, reaching outward, mimicking the extending reach of a firing neuron. At full extension, the letters are widely spaced, and a brief flicker (a tiny CSS animation simulating an electrical pulse) runs through the text from left to right. The slider is the axon; the drag is the signal; the letter-spacing is the reach.

**Styling note:** The slider track should be minimal -- a thin 1px grey line, not the default browser chrome. The thumb should be a small black circle. The pulse animation should be subtle: a brief opacity change cascading through each letter, 50ms staggered.

### Line 7: "I write about the psychic mirror that turns accident into story and the side characters each of us are into hailed muscled heroes."

**Element: `<textarea>` -- pre-filled, editable but immediately mirrored/reflected**

This is the poem's longest and most sweeping line, and it deserves the most generous HTML element. A `<textarea>` is the web's space for the reader to *write* -- it is where input is most free-form and personal. The line should appear pre-filled in the textarea as if the poet has typed it. But here is the key: the text is displayed using `transform: scaleX(-1)` -- mirrored, reversed, as if reflected in a psychic mirror. It is readable only with effort, or by selecting and copying it, or by typing over it.

If the reader begins to type in the textarea, their text also appears mirrored. They are writing into the same psychic mirror. The accident of their input becomes part of the story. The side character (the reader) is now participating in the hero's narrative.

**Alternative approach:** The textarea displays the text normally, but a CSS reflection (using `-webkit-box-reflect` or a pseudo-element with `scaleY(-1)` and reduced opacity) appears below it, creating a literal mirror image beneath the text. As the reader types, their additions are reflected too. This is gentler and more legible.

## 3. Pacing and Emotional Arc

### Overall Structure

The piece moves through five emotional registers:

```
Part 1: Observation (clinical, distanced, optical)
Part 2: Confession (stripping, building, dragging)
Part 3: Confrontation (the camera, the gaze, the explosion)
Part 4: Grief (asymmetry, indifference, floating away)
Part 5: Declaration (power, belief, the one thing)
```

### Breathing Points

The arrow button system is the piece's primary pacing mechanism. It must be designed so that each click-to-advance moment creates a micro-pause -- a breath between stanzas. The key pacing decisions:

**Part 1 should breathe slowly.** The lens interaction is meditative. Each click should feel like adjusting a dial, not pressing a button. The reader should have time to re-read the text through the lens before clicking again. The red streak should appear with a slow fade (1.5-2 seconds). The final inversion should not be instant -- it should take 800ms-1s, as if the lights are slowly being turned off.

**Part 2 should accelerate.** The slot machine clicks should feel rhythmic -- the reader develops a clicking tempo. The wall-building should be slightly faster. The draggable rectangles introduce physical engagement that naturally increases pace. By "it's hard to write a straight text anymore," the reader has built momentum.

**Between Parts 2 and 3, there should be a significant pause.** The arrow button should appear after a 2-3 second delay. This is the breath before the camera opens -- before the reader is confronted with their own face. The pause creates anticipation and slight dread.

**Part 3 is the climax and should be intense but brief.** The camera opens suddenly. "Shy" behaves aggressively, quickly. The eyes following the mouse create sustained tension. The explosion is the release -- it should be fast (500ms) and then fade slowly (2-3 seconds of particles drifting).

**Part 4 should decelerate.** After the explosion's violence, the drag interaction is deliberate and slow. The floating words are the piece's most elegiac moment -- they should drift at reading pace, giving the reader just enough time to comprehend before they leave. This is the quiet after the storm.

**Part 5 is the coda -- measured, direct, grounded.** Each HTML element interaction is discrete and contained. No explosions, no dramatic inversions. The pacing is steady: click, read, interact, click. The final textarea is the piece's resting place.

### The Arrow Button Placement

The PRD asks about fixed vs. inline placement. **The arrow should be inline**, appearing after each completed interaction, positioned just below and to the right of the last element. This does three things:

1. It forces the reader's eye downward, creating the vertical scroll as a natural reading motion.
2. It prevents the arrow from feeling like a "next slide" button in a presentation -- this is not a slideshow, it is a poem.
3. It connects the pacing to the content. The arrow appears *because* the current section is done, not as a persistent UI element waiting to be clicked.

The arrow itself should be minimal: a right-pointing arrow (-->) in Courier New, thin, grey, becoming black on hover. It should feel like a stage direction, not a navigation element.

---

## 4. The Footnote System as Counter-Voice

### Two Registers

The poem operates in two typographic and conceptual registers:

1. **The poem itself:** Times New Roman, the voice of literature, the body of the text. This is where metaphor and image live.
2. **The footnotes:** Courier New, the voice of the machine, the meta-commentary. This is where the poet steps outside the poem to examine what they are doing.

The footnotes are not explanatory in the academic sense. They do not gloss the text. They are a second consciousness -- the poet watching themselves write, commenting on the act of writing. Consider the Part 2 footnote: "As I write this, I realize I am dodging the heaviness of language by conjuring interface." This is not a footnote; it is a confession-within-a-confession. The poet admits that the very interactions the reader has just performed were evasion tactics.

### How They Should Feel

**Visually distinct but physically proximate.** The asterisk (or marker) should float next to the last word of each part -- not in a footer, not at the bottom of the page, but right there, at the seam between parts. It should feel like a whispered aside, not a reference to consult.

**The reveal should be quiet.** When clicked, the white rectangle with thin black border should appear without animation -- no fade, no slide. It should simply be there, as if it was always there and you just noticed. This mirrors the way self-awareness works: you do not gradually become aware of your evasions, you suddenly see them.

**Courier New is essential.** Monospace type carries the connotation of the terminal, the code editor, the machine. When the footnote appears in Courier New, it signals a shift from *writing poetry* to *writing about writing poetry*. The poet is in the code, looking at the source.

**The footnotes should be dismissible but slightly reluctant.** Clicking outside should close them, but with a very slight delay (200ms). The meta-voice does not want to go quiet.

### The Asterisk as Cryptic Sign

The asterisk (*) is the right choice for the marker. In typography, the asterisk historically means "born" (as in biographical dates: *1987). It also means "see note," "exception applies," "this is not the whole story." All of these meanings are active here. The asterisk says: the poem you just read has a condition attached. There is fine print to the feelings.

## 5. Lessons from "We Called Us Poetry"

### What Works and Should Carry Over

**1. HTML elements as poetic line.**
"We Called Us Poetry" uses tabs, dropdown menus, carousels, buttons, radio buttons, checkboxes, sliders, and toggles as the primary vehicles for delivering poetic text. Each HTML element is not decoration; it IS the poem. The tabs at the top are the stanzas. The dropdown is a stanza hidden inside a UI component. This principle is central to "Love Letter to the Form" and should be carried forward without dilution.

**2. The bare-bones aesthetic.**
Times New Roman body text. Courier New for interface chrome. White background. Black text. #f3f3f3 grey for secondary surfaces. #ccc for accents. 1px solid black borders. No gradients. No shadows (except the dropdown's subtle `box-shadow`). No rounded corners except where functionally necessary (slider thumbs). This restraint is essential -- it says "the browser is the medium, not the decoration."

**3. Sequential revelation through interaction.**
In "We Called Us Poetry," you must click to reveal. Each tab shows its content only on hover or click. Each section gates the next. The reader earns the poem through engagement. This is the core mechanic that "Love Letter to the Form" must preserve.

**4. The bottom-left box as paratext.**
The `+`/`x` toggle box in the bottom-left corner of "We Called Us Poetry" contains the artist statement in Courier New. This is the precedent for the footnote system in "Love Letter to the Form." The box is physically marginal (bottom-left, small) and typographically distinct (Courier New). It exists in the poem's periphery, available but not insistent.

**5. Spatial playfulness.**
The randomly offset vertical positions of radio buttons, checkboxes, and button labels in "We Called Us Poetry" create a visual unevenness that resists the grid. Text does not sit neatly. This slight disorder is poetically important -- it says "this is not a form to be filled out, this is a form being broken open."

### What Should Be Different

**1. "Love Letter" needs more deliberate pacing.**
"We Called Us Poetry" progresses through clicks, but the pacing is relatively uniform -- click, reveal, click, reveal. "Love Letter to the Form" has a dramatic arc (observation -> confession -> confrontation -> grief -> declaration) that demands variable pacing. Some sections should be slow and meditative (Part 1), others rapid and physical (Part 2), others tense and sustained (Part 3). The arrow button system should modulate this.

**2. "Love Letter" needs typographic presence.**
"We Called Us Poetry" keeps its text small and interface-scaled -- button labels, list items, short phrases. "Love Letter to the Form" contains full sentences, complex clauses, literary allusions. The text needs room to breathe on the page. Font size should be larger for the poem text (18-20px body) and the layout should give lines generous whitespace. The poem is not hiding inside the interface; the interface is serving the poem.

**3. "Love Letter" needs stronger state transitions.**
The color inversions (white-to-black in Part 1, black-to-white in Part 2) are major emotional events that have no equivalent in "We Called Us Poetry." These transitions should feel significant -- not jarring, but unmistakably intentional. A slow crossfade (800ms-1s) on both background and text color creates a sense of the entire world shifting.

**4. "Love Letter" should avoid the absolute positioning sprawl.**
"We Called Us Poetry" places elements using absolute positioning with percentage-based top/left values, which creates a specific visual effect but becomes unpredictable on different screen sizes. "Love Letter to the Form" should use a more controlled vertical flow -- elements appearing in sequence within the document flow, scrolling naturally. The single-page vertical scroll should feel like a scroll, not a scattered canvas.

**5. The camera is unprecedented and should be treated with care.**
Nothing in "We Called Us Poetry" asks for device permissions. The camera in Part 3 is a significant escalation of intimacy between the piece and the reader. It should be preceded by adequate psychological preparation (the pacing pause recommended above) and the fallback for permission-denied should feel graceful, not broken. The glinting white-grey surface (permission denied) or the retro B&W pixelated feed (permission granted) both keep the reader inside the poem's world rather than dumping them into a browser permission dialog's aftermath.

## 6. Summary of Key Design Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Interaction is not illustration** | The lens does not illustrate "border" -- it IS a border. The slot machine does not illustrate identity erosion -- it performs it. |
| **The reader's body is enrolled** | Clicking, dragging, hovering, pausing -- these are not navigation gestures, they are poetic gestures. |
| **Two typographic voices** | Times New Roman = the poem. Courier New = the machine, the meta, the footnote. Never mix these registers accidentally. |
| **Pacing is variable** | Slow in Part 1, accelerating in Part 2, tense in Part 3, decelerating in Part 4, measured in Part 5. |
| **State transitions are emotional events** | Color inversions, camera activation, explosions -- these are not effects, they are the poem's turning points. |
| **Restraint is the aesthetic** | Black, white, grey, 1px borders. The austerity of the visual design makes every interaction feel significant. |
| **The vertical scroll is a timeline** | The reader moves through the poem the way they move through time -- forward only, at a pace they control but cannot reverse. |
